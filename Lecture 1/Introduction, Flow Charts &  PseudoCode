Lecture 1 is an introductory video.
You will learn :
What is flowchart & pseudocode?
What is use of programming and why to do programming?

* FlowChart: It is visual representation of program using diagrams amd shapes having a fixed meaning.
  Example : In a flow chart the Eclipse denotes the starting and end of the program.
  Parallelogram denotes the input or output statement.
  Rectangle denotes the calculation or some arthimatic operations.
  Rhombus denotes the decision or comparison, etc.
  Note : There is no symbol or shape for loops but decision shape can be used to make loop.
  
* PseudoCode: It is general instructions without any syntax but once it is written it can be easily converted into a code.
* Programming Languages are special lamguages which can be conberted into computer understandable format which is written in a fix
  format known as syntax.
* We know that a computer can perform calculations and other action better than human beings but we can't give instuctions directly to
  computer as it only understand 0 and 1. so we write a program in a human understandable format and then a program convert it into the
  computer understandable program this program is known as compiler.
